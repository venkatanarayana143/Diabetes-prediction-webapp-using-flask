# Diabetes-prediction-webapp-using-flask
## What it does
This model predicts whether the person is diabetic or not based on the input features like pregnancy, glucose, bloodpressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, pedigree function and age. 
## How we built
This model used KNN classifier to predict, then I saved the model with help of pickle library.
I have made an app using flask framework in python, where I used the saved model which predicted earlier to show how the model really works on the webpage. Finally, the predict function takes the input from the user and once the user click on the predict button, then it will display whether the person is diabetic or not.

## What we learned
I have learned working of 1.flask framework, 2.KNN Classifier.
